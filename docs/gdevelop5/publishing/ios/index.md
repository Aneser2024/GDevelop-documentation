# Publish your game to iOS

## Making sure that your game is ready for packaging

It is important to verify that your game is ready to be exported for Android:

  * In the game properties that are accessible from the [Project Manager](/gdevelop5/interface)), make sure to enter a valid _package name_. A package name is an identifier like this: `com.yourname.gamename`. It's like the address of a website but reversed. You can choose any package name provided that:
      * It is not used by another game or application on iOS or Android.
      * It is written with only letters, numbers, and dots. Only put one dot between words (for example, `com..mygame` or `..mygame` are not valid). _Limit this identifier to 2-5 words maximum._
  * Check that you've included the required icons.

## Launch export

Click on the **Share** button in the GDevelop toolbar, then choose **iOS** and **One-click packaging**.

Choose if you want to package the game for testing it on an iPhone or an iPad, that was registered on your Apple Developer account, or if you want to publish it to App Store Connect - so it can be tested using *TestFlight* and then reviewed and published on the App Store.
